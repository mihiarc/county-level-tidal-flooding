## Preliminary Findings: Impact of Sea Level Rise on Population Distribution

This analysis examines the potential impact of sea level rise (SLR) on population distribution in the United States by 2100. A non-spatial model was used to project population changes, with and without SLR included in historical data. 

**Key Findings:**

* **Overall Population Decrease in SLR-Affected Counties:** The model predicts a significant decrease in population (-11,862,171) in counties affected by SLR, representing a 9.08% reduction.
* **State-Level Variations:** 
    * **Louisiana:** SLR could lead to a substantial population decline (-2,046,054) in affected counties, potentially resulting in a statewide population decrease of 1,989,912 (-37.78%). This suggests that SLR may drive residents not only out of affected counties but also out of the state entirely.
    * **North Carolina:** While the model predicts a population decrease (-249,072) in SLR-affected counties, the state's overall population is projected to increase by 288,727 (2.08%). This indicates that other areas within the state may absorb displaced residents, potentially including those migrating from other states like Louisiana.
    * **West Coast States:**  With no significant trends in minor flooding observed, these states may become destinations for internal migration driven by SLR.

**Table: Summary of Population Changes by 2100**

| Region | Population Difference | Percent Population Difference |
|---|---|---|
| Total SLR Counties in CONUS | -11,862,171 | -9.08% |
| Louisiana SLR Counties | -2,046,054 | -52.63% |
| Louisiana Total | -1,989,912 | -37.78% |
| North Carolina SLR Counties | -249,072 | -17.38% |
| North Carolina Total | 288,727 | 2.08% |

**Caveats:**

* This analysis utilizes a non-spatial model and preliminary data.
* The model assumes a constant US population consistent with SSP projections.
* Further refinement of data and spatial modeling may yield different results.

**Next Steps:**

* Refine data inputs and explore spatial model specifications.
* Investigate the economic and social implications of projected population changes.
* Analyze potential policy interventions to mitigate the impact of SLR on population distribution.
