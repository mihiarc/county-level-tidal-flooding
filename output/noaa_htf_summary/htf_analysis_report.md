## 3. Key Findings

1. Historical Data shows a clear trend of increasing flood frequency across all severity levels.
2. Data completeness varies significantly across stations and time periods.
3. Future projections indicate substantial increases in flooding frequency under all scenarios.
4. Hawaii stations are projected to be most severely impacted by the end of the century.
5. There is significant uncertainty in projections, with the range between scenarios increasing over time.
