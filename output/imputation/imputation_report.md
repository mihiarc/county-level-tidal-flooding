## Methodology

### Reference Point Assignment
- Each coastal reference point is assigned up to 2 nearest tide gauges
- Weights are calculated using inverse distance squared (1/dÂ²)
- Weights are normalized to sum to 1 for each point
- All reference points are preserved in the output, even those without gauge assignments

### Data Tracking
- Points/counties without gauge assignments are still tracked in the dataset
- This allows for:
  1. Understanding coverage gaps in the monitoring network
  2. Identifying areas that need additional gauge stations
  3. Future updates as new gauge stations come online

## Notes
- All coastal counties are included in the dataset, regardless of gauge coverage
- Counties without gauge assignments are preserved to:
  1. Maintain a complete inventory of coastal counties
  2. Enable future updates as gauge coverage expands
  3. Support analysis of monitoring network gaps
- This version does not restrict gauge assignments so that we can investigate gaps in gauge coverage. We will need to implement a regional based threshold for gauge coverage.

## Data Reliability Insights
- Coverage is generally better in regions with:
  1. Higher population density
  2. Major ports and maritime infrastructure
  3. Historical monitoring programs
- Areas with sparse coverage may need:
  1. Additional gauge installations
  2. Alternative monitoring approaches
  3. Careful interpretation of interpolated values
